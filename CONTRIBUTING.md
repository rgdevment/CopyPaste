# Contributing to CopyPaste

Thank you for considering contributing to **CopyPaste**! 🎉

This project exists thanks to people like you. Whether it's your first open source contribution or you're an experienced developer—**everyone is welcome here**.

## 💡 Our Philosophy

**CopyPaste** is a personal project that grew into something bigger—a community effort. It was created by an individual developer ([@rgdevment](https://github.com/rgdevment)) with a simple idea: build the clipboard tool he always wanted to use.

We believe in:
- 🎯 **Simplicity and minimalism** — Features that matter, no bloat
- ⚡ **Performance and stability** — Every millisecond counts
- 🔒 **Absolute privacy** — Your data is yours, always
- 🤝 **Collaborative community** — We build together, not in silos
- 💬 **Valuable feedback** — Your opinion matters as much as code

**This is not a commercial product.** There's no premium version, no monetization, no business plans. It's free software, created by and for the community.

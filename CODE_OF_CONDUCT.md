# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of **CopyPaste** pledge to make participation in our community a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

**CopyPaste** is a community project—built by people, for people. This code of conduct reflects our core values: transparency, collaboration, and respect.

---

## Our Philosophy

**CopyPaste** is a community effort, not a corporate product. We believe:

- 🤝 **Collaboration over competition** — We're building *with* you, not *for* you.
- 💬 **Respect over ego** — Good ideas can come from anywhere, regardless of experience level.
- 🌐 **Inclusion over exclusion** — Everyone deserves to contribute to and benefit from open source.
- 🎯 **Focus over drama** — We're here to build great software, not to argue.

---

## Our Standards

### ✅ Examples of Behavior that Contributes to a Positive Environment

- **Being welcoming and inclusive** — Assume good intentions and welcome newcomers.
- **Using respectful language** — Disagreements are fine; personal attacks are not.
- **Accepting constructive criticism gracefully** — We all have room to grow.
- **Focusing on what's best for the community** — Not just what's convenient for you.
- **Showing empathy and kindness** — Remember there's a real person behind every comment.
- **Helping others learn** — If someone asks a question, help them instead of dismissing them.
- **Giving credit where it's due** — Acknowledge contributions, big or small.

### ❌ Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

- **Harassment or trolling** — Insulting comments, personal attacks, or sustained disruption.
- **Discrimination** — Any form of prejudice based on identity or background.
- **Publishing private information** — Sharing someone's personal details without consent.
- **Sexual language or imagery** — Keep it professional.
- **Deliberate intimidation or stalking** — Online or offline.
- **Spamming or self-promotion** — This isn't a billboard for your unrelated projects.
- **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate** — Use common sense.

## Responsibilities

As the maintainer, I'm responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. I have the right and responsibility to:

- **Remove, edit, or reject** comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that aren't aligned with this Code of Conduct.
- **Ban temporarily or permanently** any contributor for behaviors that are inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**I won't abuse this power.** Moderation actions will be fair, transparent, and aimed at protecting the community—not silencing dissent or criticism.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All project spaces (GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki, etc.)
- Official communication channels (if we create them in the future)
- Public spaces when an individual is representing the project or community
- Private conversations if they involve project-related interactions

## Enforcement

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:

1. **Opening a private issue** on GitHub (if the feature is available).
2. **Emailing the project maintainer** at: **github@apirest.cl**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We are committed to respecting the privacy and security of the reporter.

### What Happens Next?

1. **I'll investigate** — Gather context, talk to people involved, and assess the situation.
2. **I'll take action** — Depending on severity:
   - **Minor violations:** A private warning and guidance.
   - **Moderate violations:** Temporary ban from project spaces.
   - **Severe violations:** Permanent ban from all project spaces.
3. **I'll follow up** — If you reported the issue, I'll let you know the outcome (within privacy limits).

### Appeal Process

If you believe you were unfairly moderated, you can appeal by emailing me at **github@apirest.cl** with:
- A brief explanation of why you believe the action was unfair
- Any relevant context or evidence

I'll review appeals with an open mind, but the final decision is mine as the project maintainer.

## Enforcement Guidelines

We follow these principles when enforcing the Code of Conduct:

### 1. **Correction**
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity about the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. **Warning**
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. **Temporary Ban**
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

## A Personal Project, Shared with the Community

**CopyPaste** started as my personal project and grew into something bigger—a community effort. That means:

- **We're all equals here** — Maintainer, contributors, and users build together.
- **I respect your time** — If you report an issue, I'll respond. If you contribute code, I'll review it fairly.
- **I'm human** — I'll make mistakes. When I do, I'll own up to them.
- **This is 100% open source** — Free, no paywalls, no hidden features. Forever.

This Code of Conduct isn't about creating a legal shield—it's about creating a space where people feel safe to contribute, learn, and build together.
